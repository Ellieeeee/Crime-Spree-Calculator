# Crime-Spree-Calculator
This is a very (very) simple program that allows the user to input their current Crime Spree level (or the host's, if they are a client) and to get the information on the current scaling of the enemies in the game. Includes enemy health, headshot breakpoints (breakpoint values include the bonus from Helmet Popping in perk decks), and damage of the weapons used (on average, damage varies on range).

This would likely be used for preparing a build beforehand (as at higher levels less and less stuff becomes viable) or to judge if the current level is too much for the player to handle. 

Can also show the rewards gained after beating a heist for any given Crime Spree Level. Shows EXP, Cash, Coins, Card Drops, and Cosmetics (Armor Skins).

No fancy GUIs, just shows up on the command line. Should be able to run standalone just fine.
